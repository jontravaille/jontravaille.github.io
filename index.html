<h2 class="section">Computer Science Autobiography</h2>
<p>
    It was my childhood when I first started using a computer since I was seven. Now I'm using my own MacBook, but at that period I was only allowed to use my father's desktop for two hours a day. I remember I played games like Rayman, and Jazz Jack Rabbit through MS-DOS back then. As I get older, I have comitted myself to internet surfing, SNS, and watching movies and drama series more. </p>
<p>
Even back in my freshman year, I thought that a computer scientist is like Tony Stark, who literally makes everything through computer(or modern technology.) When I accidentally took CS101, I realized that computer scientists are also humans - they are not always perfect and can make mistakes. </p>
<p>
    And yes, taking CS 101 was my initial step toward computer science and led me encounter an epiphany of what I am really interested in and what I should walk through in the future. Totally different languages and challenging assignments and tests but such euphoric, adrenaline rush moments after 99 failures and one final success made me ponder over one thought, "heck yeah, this is a right way to walk over!" </p>
<p>
    Now I know that computer scientists have mundane but crucial works to do on their daily basis: write, update, and revise their codes and keep on making the world better. Of course I'm more than ready to be part of them, so I would like to experience more about computer science. That is why I'm also taking interest in not only back-end but also front-end development and this course would be a great opportunity to accumulate knowledge and understanding of coding language and full-stack engineering. </p>
<p>
With those thoughts above in mind, I hope I could solidify comprehension of coding languages(such as Java, Python) that I have learned and foster learning of HTML, CSS, and Javascript with patience and ceaseless effort to make the best output on this class. </p>
<p>
  In the very near future, I hope I could become competitive enough to work as a software engineer and get a comprehensive insight of coding.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www2.cs.duke.edu/courses/fall17/compsci201/">Good Website</a></li>
    The design of this website is modern and original, and the layout is simple and easy to follow.
 <li><a href="https://services.math.duke.edu/~cbray/1718Spring/216/index.html">Bad Website</a></li>
    I like the simple, direct layout on this website, but its design is quite banal and nothing special, which makes students get easily bored with it.
 <li><a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html/">HTML TutorialsPoint</a></li>
    Tutorialspoint is always useful and will be your companion for every compsci work.
