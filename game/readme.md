An estimate of the number of hours I worked on it: 12 hours
List of the students with whom I discussed the assignment: NONE

Any books, papers, or online resources that I consulted in developing my web site: Tutorialspoint and w3schools(game and canvas tutorial), No Tears Guide to HTML5 Games(https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/canvas/notearsgame/), Stackoverflow to figure out tons of errors, Mozilla(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Introduction), jsfiddle(http://jsfiddle.net/m1erickson/RCLtR/) to figure out how to make knives fall - I used this code a lot(e.g. did not change a variable name) but gave an enough variation to fit in my code, Piazza

Any assets(code, images, or sounds) used within my web site: two images(a knife and a man) source from (http://www.i2clipart.com/clipart-knife-9ed6) and (https://www.shareicon.net/mens-room-hand-person-man-user-32320)

Any bugs or concerns still remaining within my web site: I validated my js code to make sure if there's no error on it. However, it says that there is one unused variable - initialize. I don't think this is unused since it is programmed to function by clicking the button, which is stated in "game.html." Thus, that it is unused within "survive.js" file could be acceptable enen though there is no one single code that triggers initialize().

Any extra credit features included in my web site: NONE

Description of the game: The rule is simple; move a character to the left or right (arrow keys) to avoid falling knives. If hit by a knife, you're dead and the game stops. You can play a game again by pressing left shift button. Cheat keys are explained in "game.html". A current score will be displayed on the top left. The highest score won't be recorded, but the game lets you know what the score was when you lose a game.
