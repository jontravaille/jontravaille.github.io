    <p>There's only two keys you should remember: left arrow key and right arrow key. </p>
    <h2>How to Make Things Easier / Harder</h2>
    <p>If you think it is quite easy enough to live long, press "1" and "3". Let's see whether things are still the same! On the other hand, if you keep dying so much that you be frustrated badly and can't move forward, press "2"and "4". Hope things could be much easier. </p>
