Any books, papers, or online resources that I consulted in developing my web site: 
Tutorialspoint and w3schools(CSS gradiation at the h1, image modal, checkbox, and slide show tutorial), 
Stackoverflow(how to prop and how to make sure a filter is checked in the checkbox)), cs290 lab solution, Piazza

Any assets(code, images, or sounds) used within my web site: 
zip images from assignment page and images from https://unsplash.com/

Any bugs or concerns still remaining within my web site: 
1. I validated HTML and got 4 errors; 3 of them are related to meta and
    the other one is about leaving src empty. However, this gets filled by JSON, so I don't think this should be represented as an error.
2. For validation of JS file, I unchecked an undefined variable since
    all of $ are displayed as undefined. Otherwise, it is clear.
    

Any extra credit features included in my web site: NONE

Description of the assignment: 
There are four categories: plants, plants II(High resolution images), view, and views II(High resolution images).
By clicking each checkbox, images are categorized into each subset. If you click an image, a modal pops up and
displays an enlarged image with a caption. If you press a slideshow button, you can traverse images by clicking
forward and backward button. Notice that the subset of an image is indicated in a checkbox as you execute the
slideshow.
